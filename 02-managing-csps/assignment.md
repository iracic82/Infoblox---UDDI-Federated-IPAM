## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Discovery Overview (AWS & Azure)
===

**Infoblox Universal Asset Insights** automatically discovers and tracks cloud resources using native cloud APIs.

This reduces manual overhead, keeps your inventory fresh, and enables deeper asset visibility across your multicloud environment.

‚∏ª

üîπ AWS Discovery


Infoblox connects to AWS via a cross-account IAM role, which the platform assumes using a secure External ID. The following resources are discovered:

‚Ä¢	EC2 instances, VPCs, subnets

‚Ä¢	Route tables, NAT and Internet Gateways

‚Ä¢	Load Balancers (ALB, NLB)

‚Ä¢	Route 53 Hosted Zones and Records (with optional write access)

‚Ä¢	Tags, regions, and metadata


As part of the cloud discovery integration, Infoblox uses an IAM role named infoblox_discovery to securely access your AWS environment. This role defines the permissions Infoblox uses during synchronization jobs, such as reading resource metadata or managing DNS records (if enabled).

The role is assumed using a secure ExternalId, which ensures that only Infoblox can use it ‚Äî even if the role ARN is exposed. This is a best practice for cross-account access with third-party integrations.

The screenshot below illustrates what a properly configured IAM role  looks like in the AWS Console (for the LAB environment):

![Screenshot 2025-07-09 at 08.54.34.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/ywozzymyekgv/8a5fbac55d713ee3a18864f2268d4a06/assets/Screenshot%202025-07-09%20at%2008.54.34.png)

![Screenshot 2025-07-09 at 08.54.22.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/ywozzymyekgv/4a968e8f80e1916de4c96b89e547296d/assets/Screenshot%202025-07-09%20at%2008.54.22.png)

‚∏ª

üîπ Azure Discovery

Infoblox connects to Azure using a service principal (App registration) with a custom or built-in role assignment at the subscription or resource group level. Discovered resources include:

‚Ä¢	Virtual Machines and associated NICs

‚Ä¢	Virtual Networks (VNets), subnets, peerings

‚Ä¢	Network Security Groups, DNS zones and records

‚Ä¢	Resource groups, tags, and regional metadata

‚∏ª

Configure ‚Üí Networking ‚Üí Discovery

2. Click the Cloud tab

You‚Äôll see the pre-created AWS Discovery job listed there.

3. Click Edit on the existing job

Open the job to review the configuration.

## 3) üîç Review Existing On-Prem IPAM with Federated Realms
===

Before diving into IaC automation or cloud asset visibility, let‚Äôs first explore how IP space is structured and governed within Infoblox UDDI. This challenge focuses on understanding how federated realms and delegated blocks form the foundation of centralized IP management.

üëâ Note: Federation, delegation, and policy enforcement will be covered in more depth in the next challenge‚Äîalong with the Terraform automation workflow.


‚úÖ Steps:
1.	Log into the Infoblox UDDI Web Console.
2.	From the left-hand menu, go to Configure ‚Üí Networking ‚Üí IPAM Realms.
3.	Select the ACME Corporation Federated Realm.
4.	Inspect how top-level blocks are structured (AWS, Azure, GCP,On-prem).


üìå Goal: Understand how IP address planning and hierarchy is governed before automation kicks in.

## 4) üîç UDDI Explore and Visibility of Assets
===


In this section, we validate the end-to-end visibility of assets and DNS data across cloud environments using Infoblox UDDI.

Open and login to Infoblox UDDI Portal.

‚úÖ Step 1: Verify Discovery Sync

We navigate to Configure > Networking > Discovery to confirm that discovery jobs for AWS, Azure and GCP jobs.


![Screenshot 2025-08-20 at 11.06.18.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/l95dr3nibefy/00d2edc95e6b6d25047b74b9f3732a08/assets/Screenshot%202025-08-20%20at%2011.06.18.png)


üåê Step 2: Explore AWS DNS Zones

Please login to the Infoblox Portal:

**Under Configure ‚ÜíNetworking ‚ÜíDNS ‚Üí Zones**,  review the AWS-hosted zone created earlier ‚Äî inspect its records inside the Infoblox **default** DNS View, where all zones are consolidated:

![Screenshot 2025-07-03 at 06.14.04.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/ywozzymyekgv/9b1e2fbe2c9081f55274cc2225e4ea5b/assets/Screenshot%202025-07-03%20at%2006.14.04.png)

We validate the zone infolab.com has been successfully pulled from Route 53.
Confirmed record sync with A records like:



app1.infolab.com ‚Üí 10.20.0.100

app2.infolab.com ‚Üí 10.20.2.100

app3.infolab.com ‚Üí 10.20.3.100

üè¢ Step 3: Explore Azure DNS Zones

We switch to the Azure DNS view in Infoblox Portal  following: ** Configure ‚ÜíNetworking ‚ÜíDNS ‚Üí Zones**



Confirmed zone infolab.com exists and DNS records such as:

azure-webprodeu1.infolab.com ‚Üí 10.10.1.100

azure-webprodeu2.infolab.com ‚Üí 10.10.2.100

Confirm that these were pulled from Azure Private DNS that has been created.


![Screenshot 2025-10-25 at 22.16.34.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/l95dr3nibefy/77ae3c1832e8eb487ec9294d0f258bf7/assets/Screenshot%202025-10-25%20at%2022.16.34.png)


üìä Step 4: Inspect IPAM Data

In Infoblox Portal please Navigate to **Configure ‚ÜíNetworking ‚ÜíIPAM/DHCP**  to ensure that cloud assests like VPCs, subnets, route tables etc from both AWS and Azure are discovered.

![Screenshot 2025-07-03 at 07.01.10.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/ywozzymyekgv/3cd9dc60dd0533eb9b1ca18e7e9bcdb9/assets/Screenshot%202025-07-03%20at%2007.01.10.png)

Validate the view - you have option to toggle FLAT option view as well on the right

![Screenshot 2025-07-03 at 07.10.35.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/ywozzymyekgv/efd531faa99b32aea675b6cff15661d0/assets/Screenshot%202025-07-03%20at%2007.10.35.png)

![Screenshot 2025-07-03 at 07.11.50.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/ywozzymyekgv/ed8f1957e6c42ff90b8e2333d8deef08/assets/Screenshot%202025-07-03%20at%2007.11.50.png)

üñ±Ô∏è You can click on any discovered item (such as IPs, subnets etc ) to drill down for more details like Attributes and Metadata of the assets:

Example shown in the screenshot below.

![Screenshot 2025-07-03 at 07.14.57.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/ywozzymyekgv/208fad4d2737bcbf6352bb783f5d98a8/assets/Screenshot%202025-07-03%20at%2007.14.57.png)


üìà Asset Visibility with UDDI ‚Äì Unified View

With UDDI now actively syncing asset metadata across AWS and Azure, we can inspect what Infoblox surfaces as enriched visibility.

üîç Step 1: Launch the Monitor Dashboard

In the Infoblox Cloud Console, on the left-hand menu:
Click Monitor

![Screenshot 2025-07-03 at 07.20.46.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/ywozzymyekgv/e96d6a86a9f737683ff97c8d1fc1d7f7/assets/Screenshot%202025-07-03%20at%2007.20.46.png)

At the bottom of the screen, select the Assets tab.

![Screenshot 2025-07-03 at 07.17.10.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/ywozzymyekgv/66953a1dd203b17c8bd74a9ff56fa05b/assets/Screenshot%202025-07-03%20at%2007.17.10.png)


This will present you with a visual dashboard of all discovered cloud assets.

üñ±Ô∏è You can click on any chart or widget to drill down into more granular detail ‚Äî for example:

	Asset classification (Zombie, Orphan, Ghost)
	Noncompliant assets (e.g., publicly exposed or unencrypted)
	DNS visibility (missing PTR/FWD records)
	IPAM coverage
	Asset location breakdown (CrowdStrike tags, regions)


	üìä What You‚Äôll See
	‚Ä¢	Asset by Type ‚Äì Server, Workstation, DNS, etc.
	‚Ä¢	Zombie/Orphan/Ghost breakdown
	‚Ä¢	Assets with Missing Records ‚Äì great to see DNS hygiene issues
	‚Ä¢	Noncompliant Assets ‚Äì Exposed or weak posture
	‚Ä¢	New Assets by Type ‚Äì shows what was recently discovered
	‚Ä¢	Asset Locations ‚Äì mapped by source tagging or EDR/CMDB sources


üß† Pro Tip:
Click on any individual slice  ‚Äî it‚Äôll open up a filtered view of the exact assets impacted, letting you see more advanced details and troubleshoot DNS visibility, identify risky resources, or correlate cloud-native tags.
